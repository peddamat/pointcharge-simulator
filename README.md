Point Charge Simulator                                            
=====================

This simulator lets you investigate the field lines between point
charges in a 2d plane.

Usage
-----

The program window is divided into two parts:                    
  a. Simulation window (Top)                                     
  b. Point charge menu (Bottom)                                  
                                                                
To begin the simulation, click and drag a point charge from the 
point charge menu into the simulation window.  You can arrange  
and rearrange charges at any point during the simulation.       
                                                                
Enable the field line display by pressing 'f'.                  
Enable a field line grid by pressing 'l'.
